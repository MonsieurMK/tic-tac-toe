# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle

# This workflow will first build (without testing) then run all tests when
# there is a push or a pull request on the develop branch
